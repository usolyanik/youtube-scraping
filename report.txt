The main subject of this task is getting the comments number value 
which is generated only when the user scrolls down the browser window until the value is visible.

To emulate the browser and web page scrolling I used Selenium library and Firefox browser. Running it takes some time.
To use it we should put geckodriver in the system path.

pip install selenium

The parsing task is very simple so I did not use the special libraries like lxml or BeautifulSoup. 
All work is done with regular expressions (get_value() function).

Aborting the loading a video has been implemented using page loading and scrolling timeouts.

usage:
python fetch-youtube.py --url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9DWfW2JYs8

tested on Ubuntu 18.0

P.S. There are technologies which use "headless" browsers to avoid the GUI.
